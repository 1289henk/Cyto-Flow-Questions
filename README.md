# Cyto-Flow-Questions
## When performing the shiny FlowSOM operator I don't get any output besides the FlowSOM cluster tree but no actual cluster data to work with in subsequent data steps. Do I need to run the shiny FlowSOM just for visuals and the regular FlowSOM for subsequent data steps?
Answer: Because a FlowSOM shiny can take a long time to generate it may not have been generated before the software automatically stops to save resources. This bug is being looked into
## If I run the FlowSOM and shiny FlowSOM with the same number of clusters and the same seeds, will my results be the exact same?

#Suggestions
##Shiny heatmap group names do not scale with the text size editor function
